Title: Estimating IRT Parameters using the IRT Methodology
Version: 0.1.5
Date: 2016-01-15
Author: Developed by SICS Research Group
Maintainer: Cristian Sandoval Pineda <cesandovalp@unal.edu.co>
Description: An implementation of the IRT paradigm for the scoring of different
    instruments measuring latent traits (a.k.a Abilities) and estimating item
    parameters for a variety of models, this package is highly optimized using
    Rcpp and carefully written R for the rest of the package, it aims to expand IRT
    applications to those applications that require faster and more robust estimation
    procedures. See the IRTpp documentation and github site for more information and
    examples.
